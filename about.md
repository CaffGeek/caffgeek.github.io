# Hi...wondering who this Caffeinated Geek is?

Well, first off, I'm Canadian. The .ca might have tipped you off. But what it didn't tell you was where in Canada I'm from, and that where is Winnipeg. Well technically in a small town just outside of Winnipeg...or not, depending on when your read this. Sometimes I travel.

You are probably aware that I do some computery stuff, with computers and the interwebs. And I've been doing that for a while now; since 2001 professionally. But it was a hobby prior to that. I made some eyesores on GeoCities back in the day, and wow...did I think I was smart. I'd moved on from BBSes to the internets! Somewhere in the basement are boxes of old games I'd created, and little icon editors and such, using Turbo Pascal. I've got to see if I have a floppy drive I can hook up to try and save those early works. That was a great language to learn on. I really started trying to write software sometimes in Junior High. There was a gap from when I [first was exposed to computer programming](/20-goto-10), when we didn't have a computer. Thankfully that changed, and it started me on a path to where I am today. You can read all about where I've worked, and what I know on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chadhurd).

### But what don't you know?

*   I'm a pretty good 5 pin bowler (it's a Canadian game...like 10 pin, but tougher). At present I've made 5 national appearances as a bowler (with a few shiny medals brought home). And in 2014, I got to coach at the Master Bowlers Association of Canada National Championships for the first time!
*   I like building stuff out of wood, metal, whatever, and do most of my own home renovations.
*   Obviously as a Canadian I like hockey (Go Jets Go!). And I play a weekly game in the winter with friends.
