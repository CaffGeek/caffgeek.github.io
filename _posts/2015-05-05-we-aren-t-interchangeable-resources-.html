<p>As humans, we are hardwired to classify the world around us. We classify everything all the time. It's a large part of why we can communicate with each other. It's why we are able to translate our different languages. We create general classificaitons "dog", and more specific classifications "jack russel terrier", somewhere between those is a "terrier" classificaiton.</p>
<p>We classify everyone in our industry, either genericly, as "programmers", "business analysts", "project managers". Or sometimes a little more specifically as a "c# developer", or "python programmer". But because we like to be concise, we generalize a persons skills into the most vague word that encompasses them. However, outside of explaining to your friends and family what your job is, it really conveys nothing about what you as an individual actually do. It's great to explain to a layman, but not to a professional.</p>
<p>We are all individuals; the sum of our experiences. Obvious right? Of course it is. But unfortunately, obvious truths are often ignored because they are so obvious. </p>
<p>...if so, sports would have perfect parity.</p>
