<p>I did something stupid, and accidentally pushed some .pubxml files to a public GitHub repo that contained passwords.</p>
<p>I fixed up my .gitignore file, which took care of part of it, but if you viewed the history, the password were still exposed.</p>
<p>After much mucking about, this magical line, obliterated any trace of the file in my repo.</p>
<pre lang="bash">
git filter-branch --index-filter "git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch *.pubxml" --prune-empty --tag-name-filter cat -- --all
</pre>
<p>Then this line, forced an update of the entire repo to GitHub, history and all.</p>
<pre lang="bash">
git push origin --force --all
</pre>
<p>...that was a close call.</p>
