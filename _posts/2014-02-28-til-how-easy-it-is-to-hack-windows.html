<p>Found this on a friends <a title="Systems Administration NYC" href="http://www.ppartyka.com/2014/02/info-hacking-windows-forgot-your.html" target="_blank">site</a> (which I recommend you read as he posts some great sys admin tips and tricks!)</p>

<p>We watched it, then tried it out, and it worked. It takes about 2 minutes to change the password on an account and gain access to any windows computer.</p>
<p>The basic steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>When your computer is booting, reset it during the splash screen</li>
<li>The prompt to repair appears, durin gthe repair there is an option to show the details in Notepad.exe</li>
<li>You can use it's Open/Save dialog to rename your sethc.exe (sticky keys) and replace it with a copy of cmd.exe</li>
<li>Reboot</li>
<li>On the login, hit shift 5 times, and get a cmd.exe window</li>
<li>Use the 'net' commands to reset a local admin password</li>
<li>Login and profit.</li>
</ol>
<p>It's way way way too easy.  Looks like the only way to secure your machine is to encrypt the entire drive so a password is required just to start the boot process.</p>
