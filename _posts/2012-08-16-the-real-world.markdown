Typically that phrase is a negative thing. We use it when talking to high school students. How they need to prepare for the real world, where they won't be coddled and protected by their parents.

However, sometimes we end up in a place that's the opposite. And the "real world" is a good wonderful place.

I am now employed at a great company. It's only been a week, but so far so good. It's a strange feeling not worrying all day about every little thing you do.

Having blockages removed quickly and efficiently.

Being able to work.

I'm once again able to enjoy what I do, and have started a few side projects.

It's great being in the Real World.
