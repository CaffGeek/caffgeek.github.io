What more is there to say?  Microsoft opensourced Roslyn (.NET Compiler Platform), source is avaiable on [CodePlex](http://roslyn.codeplex.com/ "Roslyn")!!!

It's fantastic news, to quote [Eric Lippert](http://ericlippert.com/2014/04/03/c-and-vb-are-open-sourced/ "Eric Lippert on Roslyn")

> What astonished me was that its not just a "reference" license, but a full on liberal Apache 2.0 license. And then to have Miguel announce that Xamarin had already got Roslyn working on linux was _gobsmacking.

It's a huge step, and something I hope Microsoft does more of.  I can't wait to find some time to dig into this code, and see how it all works.
