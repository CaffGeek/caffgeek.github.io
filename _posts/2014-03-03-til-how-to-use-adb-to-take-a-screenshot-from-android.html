<p>I was writing up another article and needed screen grabs from my device, and wanted a simple way to grab them, well, adb to the rescue!</p>
<p><code><br />
adb shell /system/bin/screencap -p /sdcard/screenshot.png<br />
adb pull /sdcard/screenshot.png screenshot.png<br />
</code></p>
<p>It's that easy.</p>
<p>The first line saves the screenshot on the device, the second pulls a file from the device to the local machine.</p>
<p>All of this assumes you have adb working and the drivers setup for your device. Which I will be showing how to do in a future post.</p>
