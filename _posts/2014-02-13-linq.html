<p>Interesting find with Entity Framework today. It likely applies to NHibernate as well.<br />
[2/12/2014 4:43:44 PM] Mike Sigsworth: If you have a query that reuses the same navigation property more than once in the query or projection, use a "let" statement to create an inline variable.<br />
[2/12/2014 4:46:21 PM | Edited 4:47:08 PM] Mike Sigsworth: For example:</p>
<p>from c in db.Customers<br />
select new {<br />
   c.Name,<br />
   c.Address.City,<br />
   c.Address.State<br />
}</p>
<p>This will cause two LEFT OUTER JOINs on the Address table to be generated in the SQL. But using the following code just generates one JOIN:</p>
<p>from c in db.Customers<br />
let address = c.Address<br />
select new {<br />
   c.Name,<br />
   address.City,<br />
   address.State<br />
}<br />
[2/12/2014 4:46:41 PM] Mike Sigsworth: Query performance will be dramatically improved.</p>
