I read that and it resonated with me; I keep coming back to it. "_Teams are immutable_", those three words speak volumes. I've worked in many different environments, both as an employee, and as a consultant. Over that time, I've noticed certain traits that good teams have, and more importantly the signs that your team or organization isn't going to succeed and live up to it's potential.

- working in many different environments  
 - both as an employee and contractor  
 - teams ++  
 - work together  
 - know what is going on  
 - solve each others problem  
 - want to help each other  
 - keep trying to work together  
 - teams can't be made up of individuals who are working on multiple teams  
 - split focus  
 - no community  
 - try to pass the buck  
 - teams are immutable, changing a team member doesn't change the team, it creates a new team
