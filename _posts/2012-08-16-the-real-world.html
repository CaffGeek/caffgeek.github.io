<p>Typically that phrase is a negative thing.  We use it when talking to high school students.  How they need to prepare for the real world, where they won't be coddled and protected by their parents.</p>
<p>However, sometimes we end up in a place that's the opposite.  And the "real world" is a good wonderful place.</p>
<p>I am now employed at a great company.  It's only been a week, but so far so good.  It's a strange feeling not worrying all day about every little thing you do.</p>
<p>Having blockages removed quickly and efficiently.  </p>
<p>Being able to work.</p>
<p>I'm once again able to enjoy what I do, and have started a few side projects.</p>
<p>It's great being in the Real World.</p>
