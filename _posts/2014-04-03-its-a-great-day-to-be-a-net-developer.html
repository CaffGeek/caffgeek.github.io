<p>What more is there to say?  Microsoft opensourced Roslyn (.NET Compiler Platform), source is avaiable on <a title="Roslyn" href="http://roslyn.codeplex.com/" target="_blank">CodePlex</a>!!!</p>
<p>It's fantastic news, to quote <a title="Eric Lippert on Roslyn" href="http://ericlippert.com/2014/04/03/c-and-vb-are-open-sourced/" target="_blank">Eric Lippert</a></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="line-height: 1.5;">What astonished me was that its not just a "reference" license, but a full on liberal Apache 2.0 license. And then to have Miguel announce that Xamarin had already got Roslyn working on linux was </span><em style="line-height: 1.5;">gobsmacking</em><span style="line-height: 1.5;">.</span></p></blockquote>
<p>It's a huge step, and something I hope Microsoft does more of.  I can't wait to find some time to dig into this code, and see how it all works.</p>
